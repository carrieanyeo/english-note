I'm very glad you could come, Mr. Liu. Will you take a seat at the head of the table? It's an informal(非正式的) dinner, please don't stand on ceremony(礼节,客气)... Mr. Liu, would you like to have some chicken?很高兴你能来，刘先生。请上座。这是一顿家常便饭，请不要客气。刘先生，要吃一点鸡肉吗？

Thank you. This is my first time to come to a Chinese restaurant. Could you tell me the different features(特征,特色) of Chinese food?谢谢。这是我第一次来中式餐厅。请给我讲讲中国菜的不同特色吗？

Generally speaking, Cantonese(广东的,广东人) food is a bit(少,一点) light(轻的); Shanghai food is rather(稍微) oily(油的); and Hunan dishes(餐，餐具) are very spicy, having a strong and hot taste.简单来说，广东菜量少，上海菜偏油，湖南菜很辣油很强很重的味道。
一般来讲，广东菜清淡一些；上海菜比较油腻：湖南菜香味浓，辣味很重。

Chinese dishes are exquisitely prepared, delicious, and very palatable. They are very good in colour,flavour,and taste.中国菜很精致，可口，美味，颜色味道口感都很好（色香味俱全）
